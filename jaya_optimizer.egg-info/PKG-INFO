## Features

- Supports continuous, discrete, and mixed-variable optimization.
- User-friendly interface for defining objective functions and constraints.
- Handles maximization and minimization problems.
- Tracks convergence history for analysis.
- Automatically adapts to user-defined variable boundaries.
